exclude-folders
===============

Brackets extension for excluding folders from the file tree, find in files, and quick open.

To install:

1. Launch Brackets
2. Select _File > Extension Manager..._ or click the Lego icon in the toolbar
3. Click the "Install from URL..." button
4. Paste (or enter) `https://github.com/gruehle/exclude-folders` and click "Install"

By default, this extension excludes all `node_modules` folders. If you want to exclude additional folders, edit the regular expression on line 41 of `main.js`. For example, if you want to exclude all items that contain the words `node_modules`, `bin`, and `componenets`, use:

```js
    return !name.match(/node_modules|bin|components/);
```

Note that this will match these words *anywhere* in the folder *or* file name. For example, if you have a folder named "my-components", it will also be excluded. You can use the `^` and `$` anchors to ensure that the name must be a complete match:


```js
    return !name.match(/^(node_modules|bin|components)$/);
```

Matching is case sensitive by default. Add `i` to the end to make it case-insensitive:


```js
    return !name.match(/^(node_modules|bin|components)$/i);
```
